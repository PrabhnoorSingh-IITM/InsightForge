# Pitch for Judges

## One-Liner
An AI research copilot for E-Commerce teams that turns scattered commerce data into strategic, decision-ready actions.

## Why this matters
Most dashboards show metrics; they do not explain **what to do next**.

Our agent bridges that gap by combining:
- Product quality signals (reviews)
- Commercial signals (pricing, conversion, returns)
- Competitive intelligence (feature and listing gaps)
- Business context (goal + KPI memory)

## Innovation Highlights
- Dual analysis modes for speed vs depth
- Domain-aware memory for personalization
- Built-in uncertainty framework (confidence + completeness + risk flags)
- Follow-up refinement support (margins, negative reviews, premium competitors)

## Business Impact
- Faster root-cause diagnosis for underperforming SKUs
- Better pricing and assortment decisions
- Higher confidence in product roadmap and category expansion bets
- Lower analysis cost per query via adaptive mode selection

## Demo Storyline
1. Open the Research Console and upload datasets
2. Run Quick Mode on an underperforming SKU
3. Expand to Deep Mode for competitor feature gaps
4. Ask memory-based question: “what category should I explore next?”
5. Show API endpoint for production integration
6. Share hosted webapp URL for end-to-end assessment

## Why this can scale
- Works with JSON/CSV today; can connect to warehouse streams later
- API-first architecture for dashboard integration
- Structured outputs compatible with PM, growth, and category workflows
- Deployment-ready with single-service hosting and optional API-key security
